# Light Within The Void — Static Site

This is a simple, fast, static website you can host for free.

## Local preview

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (no cost)
1. Create a new public repo on GitHub (e.g., `light-within-the-void`).
2. Upload the files from this folder.
3. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**.
4. Set **Source** to `Deploy from a branch`, pick branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`.
5. Save. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Custom domain (optional)
- In **Settings → Pages**, add your custom domain (you'll need to buy one separately).
- Point your domain's DNS to GitHub Pages per their docs.
