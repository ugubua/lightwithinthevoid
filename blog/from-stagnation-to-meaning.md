      <h3>Finding Your Purpose</h3>
      <p>Often in life, we can get lost in the routine that is our existence. Days pass by, we wake up, go to work, take the same route home, do our evening routine, then go to bed just to hit replay the next day. It’s easy to lose sight of our dreams, our vision, and most importantly, of who we truly are. When we get lost in stagnation, these important things slowly and silently begin to fade away until one day we wake up and realize months, years, or even decades have passed us by.</p>

      <h3>The Why of Stagnation</h3>
      <p>Often, we are chasing single-point focus. Whether digesting content, watching TV, reading, or playing video games, these activities help us anchor our minds to one thing and drown out invasive thoughts and feelings that want to surface. Any moment of silence can feel unbearable, such as late nights lying in bed trying to sleep or the waves of chaos when we’re stuck in traffic. Let’s face it, many of us don’t like spending time with ourselves because it can get dark. But all these little distractions add up, feeding that voice inside and making stagnation more of an escape than a call to action.</p>

      <h3>So Why Is Purpose Important?</h3>
      <p>Purpose helps us gain focus and clarity. It is moving away from societal expectations and embracing what truly brings us joy, something we can do with ease. When we live in alignment with purpose, everything in our lives evolves: our work, our relationships, and most importantly, our personal growth.</p>
      <p>Purpose doesn’t just motivate us. It calls forth the best parts of ourselves to create something greater than us. When we live with purpose, we live in flow, and when we live in flow, abundance flows effortlessly into our lives. Purpose is striving to build a dream. It is living in alignment with our gifts and passions, allowing us to pour ourselves fully into our work.</p>

      <h3>What Is Not Purpose</h3>
      <p>Some people confuse purpose with success. Being successful is not bad, but often success is a goal we chase when we feel lack or a need to prove our worth. Have you ever noticed how many millionaires suffer from depression? Money is great, but once we hit a certain level of comfort, it cannot buy happiness or fulfillment. In fact, it can make us feel more out of alignment than ever before.</p>
      <p>Another common confusion is following a path laid out by family or peers. Often, they want us to be safe and successful, but their vision is their path, not ours. When we are in our purpose, we chase our own vision and our own dream. We try to be the change we want to see in the world.</p>

      <h3>How Do We Find Our Purpose?</h3>
      <p>This is the question so many people get hung up on, and it can feel impossible to answer once we are caught up in the machine of modern life. If you feel lost and without direction, it may be time to sit in silence and ask yourself the hard questions you have been avoiding. Maybe it is time to remove the mask you made for validation and fitting in, and reflect on who you truly are underneath it all.</p>
      <p>Psychologist Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences claims there are eight spheres of intelligence, and we all have strengths in one or two: music, architecture, communication/interpersonal skills, math, natural science, and introspection, to name a few. I personally believe there are even more. The key is learning where your natural understanding lies.</p>
      <p>What do you find fascinating that you cannot stop learning about? For me, it was psychology and people. That drives my purpose: to help people get out of their heads and into their lives, rebuild community, and help end the tribalism so rampant in our society today.</p>

      <h3>Practical Exercises to Find Purpose</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask yourself what you found fascinating or enjoyable as a child. What was your dream job?</li>
        <li>Consider which hobbies you have always wanted to try but have not. Which ones bring you deep passion?</li>
        <li>Identify your strengths and your weaknesses.</li>
        <li>Journal daily about your thoughts, beliefs, and desires.</li>
        <li>Ask close friends or family what they think your strengths are or what work they see you excelling at.</li>
        <li>Spend time away from distractions to let your mind decompress. Meditate, hike, or take a simple walk around the block.</li>
        <li>Identify your core values and what aligns with who you truly are.</li>
        <li>Seek support. Find mentors, coaches, or communities that share your vision and passions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Embrace the Journey</h3>
      <p>We all want the destination, the dream life, the security, but the journey is what is most important. That is where the stories are made and the character is built. Whether your ship is caught in a storm or you discover an island of beauty you never knew existed, the journey is where we learn to embrace the present and take action.</p>
      <p>Start small. Make the idealized version of yourself the next step, not the end goal. Love yourself for who you are today. Be your own best friend instead of your harshest critic. Allow yourself to be a novice; the first steps are always messy and uncoordinated. Remember, it takes about 10,000 hours to master a skill, so do not expect perfection at the start.</p>
      <p>Get in touch with what makes your heart sing and your soul rise. Find that hidden passion you have been avoiding or afraid to chase. Remove the limitations, whether they come from society or from yourself. Live the life you want, and go after the dreams you only whisper about when no one is listening.</p>

      <p>You only live once, and there is no greater gift you can give yourself than living a life authentically aligned with your dreams, your values, and your purpose.</p>
